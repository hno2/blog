In Improv there is a model that classifies people on the spectrum of Pirates, Ninjas, and Robots.

## Pirates 
> A pirate is happiest when he swings on board a boat ready to attack and has no idea what will happen next. &mdash; <cite>Billy Merritt</cite>

Pirates jump into scenes with bold ideas and high energy, are playful and their credo is *Just do it!*.

## Robots
> A robot player is always analyzing, running the program of the scene, S/he is constantly bringing the audience back to reality and asking, 'what is my character and how would they react truthfully to this?' &mdash; <cite>Billy Merritt</cite>

Robots try to understand a scene and their character deeply, they add necessary details, and are good at connecting strings.


## Ninjas

> The ninja is the one who steers the scene here or there, the great justifier, the one with no ego. A ninja-like player edits and you never see them edit. The ninja is the one who connects all the scenes together. &mdash; <cite>Billy Merritt</cite>

Ninjas can do both, they make bold choices to connect strings and go in and out of scenes stealthily. 

## Conclusio

> The idea is: attack a scene like a pirate, analyze a scene like a robot, edit a scene like a ninja. &mdash; <cite>Jimmy Carrane</cite>

Good Improv needs all three types of personalities. Think about what personality type you are and if this model influences your behavior.
