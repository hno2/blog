## Recap 2020
I set out less than a year ago with the goal to more more books. Starting with one book a week, i soon upped my goal to 52 and then finally to 65 books. In the end I read a total of 67 books with a number of 21.000 pages. 
My favorite books this year were *"Narzi√ü und Goldmund"* by Herman Hesse and *"Sprint"*.
For 2020 the same goal is set, at least one book a week. To make this a bit more challenging I set my goal to 70 books, we will see how this goes...
I am also currently starting a reading circle with some friends to "spread the joy of reading". Yeah!


2019 in April I had a very late "new years resolution". Since starting university I was reading only about two books a year. In my room there was a shelf dedicated to books, but I almost never touched it. So my private little "bookshop" was growing faster than I could read them

## The Trigger
Like many evenings I was casually scrolling through Netflix and YouTube, when this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIW5jBrrsS0) caught my eye. It is one of the best videos I saw in a long time. The video set me back to my childhood where I went to our local library each saturday to get new books. I also relived the happy evenings of reading till late, caused by a exciting book. 
It seems like the current "Golden Age of Content" is making it harder and harder for me to read. Of course I regularly read blogs, news or other websites. But still I had to ask myself: ** When was the last time you read a book?**


## The Goal 
The goal was very basic and simple. Read one book a week, staring now. 

## My Progress
To be completely honest with you starting was a pain in the ass. I tried different tactics - forcing myself to read 25 pages or half an hour a day. But it was not working well. Too often one book was boring me. One tip from the video was reading multiple books at a time. This was working better now. Even better once I started mixing books about knowledge with regular "fun" reading books.   
I went around to my friends and family and ask them all for their favorite books. I entered them all into GoodReads to keep track of them all and so I never run out of books to read.
By lending the books from my friends or checking free book shelves around the city I do not buy new books very often.
The [University Library of KIT](https://www.bibliothek.kit.edu/) offers a lot of books across all topics. If you [ask them nicely]({filename}../university/secrets.md) they will even buy a specific book for you. 

To track my progress I use the [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102347383-simon), you can check out my current progress [here](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621-2020-reading-challenge).

## Lessons Learned
Most of the time I really still enjoy reading books. By logging my books with GoodReads I can appreciate looking back and checking out the books I read so far. 
But sometimes - especially if I do not like a book 100%  - I have to force myself to read. I usually challenge myself to read for a specific time (e.g. 1 hour) or number of pages if I really do not like it. But often enough I just start or continue another book. Reading half an hour before going to bed helps me relay immensely.  
But the biggest benefit of all: You dive in deep into stories, characters and thoughts. Wether you like them or not every book will give you something in return for reading them.
