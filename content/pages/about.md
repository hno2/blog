Moin!

I'm Simon and this is my blog. 
Why write a blog you might ask? 
Mainly I want to document random things I learn.
This is probably things in and around

* **Tech**, especially Python and  Machine Learning
* **Teaching** things I just learned and writing about Education 
* **Karlsruhe** and my university the [Karlsruhe Institute for Technology](https://www.kit.edu/)
* Theatre, Cooking, and other random things that float in my head

## Profile

**In ♥️ with AI**

![Venn of my profile - Humans - Technical Challenges - Innovation](../images/venn.png)

I work best in environments that have three key factors: 

* **Humans** - I need regular interaction with others to function, I love helping and facilitating others and reaching goals together.
* **Technical Challenges** on a high level - I am not a code monkey or the best programmer, but I understand concepts and technical details fast. I enjoy learning new things and to familiarize myself with complex topics.
* **Innovation** - Creativity and rapid prototyping are my jam.

I look forward to combine my in-depth experience in different topics of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence with a human touch. How can I help you fall in love with Artificial Intelligence?

## About this blog
If you have not noticed this blog loads fast. Too much of the web is bloated by huge pages, so my approach is minimal and mostly text-based. The Design of this blog is heavily inspired by the blog of the amazing [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/).
