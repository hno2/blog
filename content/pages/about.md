Hey there!

I'm Simon and this is my blog. 
Why write a blog you might wonder? 
Honestly, I just googled something for the fifth time, so I needed a way to document random things I learn.
I think in chaos there is power, as well as in structure. Therefore you will find different topics on here. These range from 

* **Tech**, especially Python and  Machine Learning
* **Teaching** things I just learned and writing about Education 
* **Karlsruhe** and my ex-university the [Karlsruhe Institute for Technology](https://www.kit.edu/)
* to creativity, theatre, cooking, and other random things that float in my head

## Profile

**In ♥️ with AI**
I am currently bringing my love of AI and digitalization to my day job at Bosch, where I am creating and coordinating the efforts to train employess in these fields. But I also offer regular internal coachings and workshops both technical as well as soft skills related like Presentation Training, Storytelling or Teambuilding.  

![Venn of my profile - Humans - Technical Challenges - Innovation](../images/venn.png)

I learned that I work best in environments that have three key factors: 

* **Humans** - I need regular interaction with others to function, I love helping and facilitating others and reaching goals together.
* **Technical Challenges** on a high level - I am not a code monkey or the best programmer, but I understand concepts and technical details fast. I enjoy learning new things and to familiarize myself with complex topics.
* **Innovation** - Creativity and rapid prototyping are my jam. I love to work on new ideas and to bring them to life.

I look forward to combine my in-depth experience in different topics of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence with a human touch. How can I help you fall in love with Artificial Intelligence?

## About this blog
If you have not noticed this blog is extremly lightweight. Too much of the web is bloated by huge and overly complex pages, so my approach is minimal and mostly text-based. The design of this blog is heavily inspired by the blog of the amazing [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/).
