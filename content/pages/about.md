**Welcome, Fellow Explorers of the Curious Mind!**

I'm Simon Klug, your guide through the eclectic corridors of my blog, where curiosity runs wild and learning knows no bounds.

Now, you might be wondering, "*Why another blog in the vast expanse of the internet?*" Well, let me share my secret: I've lost count of how many times I've Googled the same thing for the fifth, or was it the fifteenth, time? So, I decided it's high time to create a digital sanctuary where I can corral all the intriguing and quirky tidbits I stumble upon.

By day, I'm the AI aficionado at Bosch, igniting the flames of knowledge to train our teams for the ever-evolving future. But my journey doesn't halt at the doors of technology. When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you'll find me living life on the thrilling edge.

Picture me on a theatre stage, ad-libbing my way through captivating stories, or sprinting through landscapes, my feet pounding out the rhythms of exhilaration. In the kitchen, I'm a culinary alchemist, conjuring up culinary delights. And then there's my unyielding passion for acrobatics; let's just say, gravity and I have an ongoing debate.

But my blog isn't just about my pursuits. It's a testament to the sweet spot between order and chaos. Within these virtual pages, you'll embark on a journey spanning:

- **Tech Marvels**: Delve into the wonders of everyday automation, Python sorcery, and the captivating world of Machine Learning.
- **Learning Tales**: I'll unravel the secrets of what I've recently learned and share my musings on the ever-evolving landscape of education.
- **Karlsruhe Chronicles**: This is where I reminisce about the days at my alma mater, the [Karlsruhe Institute for Technology](https://www.kit.edu/), and dive into the cultural tapestry of Karlsruhe itself.
- And then there's the canvas of creativity, the allure of [theatre]({filename}../life/theatre.md), gastronomic escapades, and those whimsical thoughts that float through my ever-curious mind.

So, if you're ready to embark on a journey of endless curiosity, explore the captivating chaos that is life, and perhaps pick up a trick or two along the way, then you've found your digital haven. Join me in this delightful dance of learning, passion, and the beautiful messiness of existence.

## About this blog
If you have not noticed this blog is extremly lightweight. Too much of the web is bloated by huge and overly complex pages, so my approach is minimal and mostly text-based. The design of this blog is heavily inspired by the blog of the amazing [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/).
