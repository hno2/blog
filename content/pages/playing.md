> All the world's a stage,
> And all the men and women merely Players - William Shakespeare

Ahoy, fellow Players on life's grand stage!

In the vast theatre of existence, the words of William Shakespeare echo profoundly for me. Theatre has been a wellspring of wisdom, laughter, and growth, and it fills me with joy to share these enriching experiences with you.

I'm Simon, an ardent theatre enthusiast, actor, and director, deeply rooted in this vibrant world that has not only been [my playground](https://simonklug.de/my-theatre-journey) but also my mentor. Now, I stand here, eager to give back and extend my knowledge to all those seeking it.

Whether you picture me embodying a character, guiding a show, providing coaching, or leading an engaging workshop, I am thrilled to be at your side. [Let's set sails!](mailto:simon@simonklug.de)

### Movement Workshops
Ever wanted to elevate your acting through movement? Join me in these workshops where we'll explore movement techniques to infuse a grounded and authentic style into your performances. I'll share valuable insights and exercises that enhance your physical presence on stage, because let's face it, most of our communication out there is through our bodies, not words. Inspired by exercises from Contact Improv, Intimacy Coordination, and the Viewpoints Technique, this workshop provides a framework you can (re-)use as you please. Safety is paramount, so any physical interaction is always based on consent, ensuring a secure environment for all performers.
